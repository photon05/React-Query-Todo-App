Getting Started
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Start the development server
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/photon05/React-Query-Todo-App>
cd React-Query-Todo-App
npm install
npm start
```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
5. Start adding and managing your tasks!
6. Enjoy using the Todo App!

I have made a simple server using Node.js and Express.js to handle the backend operations.
This application does not have a database, and I have used a simple array to store the tasks in memory. I will implement a database in the future to persist the tasks.
Also I haven't deployed the server yet, I will deploy it in the future by putting the backend logic into a separate repository.
